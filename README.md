## Title of Project
Let Me Present

## Description
**Let Me Present** is a website that I created to present animals that I found interesting. It's also a way to express myself in some way through coding.

### Inspiration for The Project
I wanted to do a project that would show who I am as a person but also would be fun for me to do. So, I thought "what's better than doing a website about animals?" Then, I just did it.

### Technologies/Languages that I used for This Project
- Visual Studio Code
- Live Server Extension
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I wanted to add to the project but didn't
- Sticky navbar
- I did make the navbar sticky at first, but I noticed that it was outputting a lot of errors in the console, so I decided to take it out.
- Dropdown buttons for navbar
- I wanted to have dropdown buttons so that I can write not only about animals but also other things like places in the world. I did attempt to do so, but the dropdown buttons didn't line up on one single line together. It kept being on their own single line, even when I use ``display: inline-block``. At one point, I decided to remove them.
- Add more animals
- My original plan was to write about birds, bears, cats and hedgehogs. When I was writing about pandas, I felt very burnt out. The project wasn't fun to do anymore and I couldn't think of anything to write for cats, even though I absolutely love cats. So, I removed cats and hedgehogs from the website. Maybe one day, I will return to this project and add them to the website. But, for now, there will be only bears and birds.

### My Opinions on This Project
At first, I really did enjoy doing this project because it's about animals and it also showcases a side of myself to the world. But, as I was doing it, I started to feel very burnt out. I think it was for a whole week, I'd been working on only web development both during work (a separate project for work term) and during my free time (this project). So, it was very stressful and exhausting. 

I felt this project isn't as good as I thought it would be. This project was basically just a blog that I created, not something that can solve problems and showcase my full skills. Despite that, this project is good for me to practice HTML, CSS, and JS outside of work and school. I took my time to find some things that I never knew before and it's rewarding to think that I'm capable of creating something on my own.

Nevertheless, I'm glad that I did work on this project. Maybe I will return to it someday and add a JS Framework to it to make it prettier. But, I will do something different other than web developemt like cybersecurity.

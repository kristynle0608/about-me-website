## Title of Project
Let Me Present

## Description
**Let Me Present** is a website that I created to present animals that I found interesting. It's also a way to express myself in some way through coding.

### Inspiration for The Project
I wanted to do a project that would show who I am as a person but also would be fun for me to do. So, I thought "what's better than doing a website about animals?" Then, I just did it.

### Technologies/Languages that I used for This Project
- Visual Studio Code
- Live Server Extension
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I wanted to add to the project but didn't
- Sticky navbar
- I did make the navbar sticky at first, but I noticed that it was outputting a lot of errors in the console, so I decided to take it out.
- Dropdown buttons for navbar
- I wanted to have dropdown buttons so that I can write not only about animals but also other things like places in the world. I did attempt to do so, but the dropdown buttons didn't line up on one single line together. It kept being on their own single line, even when I use ``display: inline-block``. At one point, I decided to remove them.
- Add more animals
- My original plan was to write about birds, bears, cats and hedgehogs. When I was writing about pandas, I felt very burnt out. The project wasn't fun to do anymore and I couldn't think of anything to write for cats, even though I absolutely love cats. So, I removed cats and hedgehogs from the website. Maybe one day, I will return to this project and add them to the website. But, for now, there will be only bears and birds.

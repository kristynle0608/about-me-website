## Title of Project
Let Me Present

## Description
**Let Me Present** is a website that I created to present animals that I found interesting. It's also a way to express myself in some way through coding.

### Inspiration for The Project
I wanted to do a project that would show who I am as a person but also would be fun for me to do. So, I thought "what's better than doing a website about animals?" Then, I just did it.

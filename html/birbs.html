    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span>I think birds are severely underrated. We rave about dogs, cats, and basically other animals 
        but we rarely mention about birds. I find that very unfair to these marvellous creatures because birds have the most 
        diversity, in my opion. They have numerous species and each specie has their own unique trait. Have you noticed that?

    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span>Okay, hear me out.</div>
    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span>In today's age, many people consider pigeons as a nuisance. Honestly, can't blame them.
        They don't do much, and if they actually do something, it isn't anything good. Pigeons can also be a menance. 
        In Saint John, if you have any food on you, they pretty much swarm you. <b>Literally.</b>

    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span>Trust me. I learned that on my first day of my co-op work term.

    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span>But, did you know that pigeons played a huge role in the <i>First World War</i>?
        Soldiers used carrier pigeons to deliver messages when radios were unusable. These pigeons always delivered to the receiver,
        and many of them had saved multiple troops by doing so. We sometimes forget that they also risked their lives doing
        their duty since it required them to fly through warzones. Some were injured and some were even killed.
    </div>

    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span>I think it's really important that we remember these carrier pigeons and other animals that 
        served during the wars since they did not ask to be involved in them. Despite everything, they did their best to complete their duty
        and thus, ended up saving many lives.

    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span><i>Birds of Paradise</i> are incredibly extravagant creatures. Their colours
        are undeniably beautiful and they have something that is very unique that I am unable to explain. 
        My Science teacher in 10th grade introduced our class to them, and I just fell in love with them.

        Most importantly, I want you to know that this bird is a dancer. Don't believe me? Just watch the video yourself.

        The boi cleans the branch, actually CLEANS the branch, before the female bird arrives and does his little dancey dance to court her?
        This bird is an absolute legend, and deserves your every attention. Need I say more?

        PENGUINSSS!!!!

    <div class="text"><span class="tab"></span>
        Penguins are probably the best birds that have ever existed in the universe. I'd never met someone who hates penguins,
        so it's safe to say that we, as human beings, can collectively agree that penguins are awesome.

        I mean, just look at the way they walk...

    <div class="text margin-top"><span class="tab"></span>
        And considering the fact that Hollywood even made movies about penguins is enough to prove that penguins are the standards for birds.
